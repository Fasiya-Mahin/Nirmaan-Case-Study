# Nirmaan-Case-Study
This project is my submission for the Nirmaan Education AI Internship Case Study.
I built a complete Spoken Introduction Evaluator that scores a transcript based on the rubric provided by Nirmaan. The tool uses a hybrid approach combining:
- Rule-based NLP
- Vocabulary & grammar analytics
- Filler word detection
- Length & structure scoring
- Optional semantic similarity 
- Clean, aesthetic Streamlit UI with glassmorphism design

The evaluator produces:
- Overall score
- JSON output
The entire system is modular, explainable, and easy for non technical users to operate.
